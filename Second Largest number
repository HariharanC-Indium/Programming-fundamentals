# Algorithm for finding second largert number in an array/list

1.	Initialize two variables ‘firstMax’ and ‘secMax’ and assign both with the value ‘-100’
2.	Select the first element in the array
3.	If the selected element is greater than ‘firstMax’, then ‘secMax’ = ‘firstMax’ and ‘firstMax’ = selected element
4.	Else if the the selected element is lesser than ‘firstMax’ but greater then ‘secMax’, ‘secMax’ = selected element
5.	If selected element is not the last element of the array, select the next element in the array
6.	Repeat from step 3
7.	Else print the value of ‘secMax’
